# CFG_HP_Project
This was the final project I presented in the Code First Girls X Bank of America Scholarship Intro to Python Career Switcher programme with partner, Jackie Hidalgo.

Project Brief: Top Trumps

In this project, the task was to create a small game where players compare stats, similar to the Top Trumps
card game. The basic flow of the games is:
1. You are given a random card with different stats
2. You select one of the card's stats
3. Another random card is selected for your opponent (the computer)
4. The stats of the two cards are compared
5. The player with the stat higher than their opponent wins

We were told the standard projects usually use a Pokemon API but we wanted to extend our Project and make it Harry Potter themed using the following API (https://hp-api.herokuapp.com/ ). 

However, there were multiple blank field for characters in the API and limited numeric characteristic which made it difficult to use this for our Project. 
I created a csv file for the character statistics, so we could showcase our project without a chance of errors due to null values. 

When creating this project, we had the user experiance in mind and added Harry Potter music and the colorama install to print the characteristic card in the house colours.
Additional extentions to this project allowed the player to choose the number of rounds they play and recording the score throughout the game.
